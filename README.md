## ⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline  

### What is CI/CD?  
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) automate testing, building, and deployment, ensuring faster and more reliable releases.  

### Benefits  
- Faster deployment cycles  
- Automated testing reduces human error  
- Consistent and reliable releases  
- Improved collaboration across teams  

### Tools Used  
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates build and testing pipelines  
- **Docker:** Containerizes app for consistency  
- **AWS/DigitalOcean/GCP:** Deployment environments  

### Pipeline Flow  
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub  
2. GitHub Actions triggers automated tests  
3. Docker builds container images  
4. Staging deployment for QA  
5. Production deployment with NGINX + Gunicorn
